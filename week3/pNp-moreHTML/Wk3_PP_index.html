            <p>The Switch stands out from the Xbox One and PS4 with its ability to, well… switch. You can place the tablet-esque console on a dock and use it through your TV, attach controllers to the sides of it and use it as a handheld system, or prop it up on your desk and use it with a wireless gamepad. The heart of the Switch lies in its Joy-Con controllers, which allow for motion controls, can be used sideways as mini-controllers and pack an "HD rumble" feature that mimics the feel of actual objects.
            </p>
            <p>In contrast, the PS4 and Xbox One are traditional living room gaming consoles, though they're not without any distinguishing features. Both systems play Blu-rays, and the higher-end Xbox One S and PS4 Pro models can even stream 4K content. The Xbox One S also supports 4K Blu-rays.

            <h3>Aside</h3>
            
            <p>The Switch's 6.2-inch touch screen sports a 1280 x 720 resolution, though the system can output to full 1080p when docked to your TV. The console sports 32GB of onboard storage that you can expand with microSD cards, and it charges over USB Type-C. The system lasts for roughly 3 to 6 hours depending on what you're playing, and allows you to snap screenshots and videos.
            </p>
            <p>The Xbox One and PS4 are capable of much higher graphics fidelity, both packing powerful AMD Radeon graphics cards and 8GB of RAM (the Switch reportedly has 4GB). Both systems start with 500GB of storage that can be expanded with external hard drives. Unlike the Switch, the PS4 and Xbox One can both broadcast gameplay to services such as Twitch and Mixer.
            </p>
            <p>Both consoles also come in premium, powered-up variations: the $499 Xbox One X and the $399 PS4 Pro. The Xbox One X is the most powerful console available right now, and plays lots of games in native 4K with some added performance perks. The PS4 Pro isn't quite as powerful, but still supports upscaled 4K gaming for many titles. The PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One S and Xbox One S all support High Dynamic Range (HDR) for better color and brightness on supported TVs.

        <p>The Switch, PS4 and Xbox One all excel at different things, and picking between the three comes down to your priorities. Naturally, the Switch is the only place you'll play the latest and greatest Nintendo games, and is the only home console that doubles as a handheld gaming machine. The PS4 has the strongest overall lineup of AAA exclusives, and is the only console that supports virtual reality. Meanwhile, the Xbox One S is arguably the best overall value of the three, thanks to its 4K Blu-ray player and backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 and Xbox games. There's truly no bad pick between the three — it just comes down to what (and where) you like to play.
